# onboarding

Welcome to the lab! This guide helps you get up and running as quickly and smoothly as possible. It covers technical setup, lab tools, workflows, and key expectations.

What you will find in this repo:

- [Checklists](checklists.md): a set of steps you should make sure you go through when joining the lab in the first week and month
- [Shared code structure](code-structure.md): how and why we organise our code in this way
- [Git-workflow](git-workflow.md): an overview of how we use Git and Github in the lab, including standard repo structure

Many of the UCD-wide suggestions in the onboarding checklist are based on the [onboarding resources](https://www.ucd.ie/hr/resourcing/researchfundedresourcing/onboardinginformation/) from UCD. If you see anything missing here, or if you have suggestions or notice outdated steps, please open an issue or pull request.
